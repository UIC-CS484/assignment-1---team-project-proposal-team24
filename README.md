assignment-1---team-project-proposal-team24 created by GitHub Classroom

I have two branches, test_branch and main. test_branch will be for developing code. Once the code is good to go, I will put it in the main branch by using a combination of git commands (preferably), the GitHub GUI, and/or by copying and pasting code. 

I am doing the project individually. My responsibilities include code development, security, and hosting the site somewhere. 

The tools I plan using include Visual Studio Code, Git, GitHub and GitHub Actions, and perhaps Docker and and external service to host my site on.

assignment-1---team-project-proposal-team24 created by GitHub Classroom

I have two branches, test_branch and main. test_branch will be for developing code. Once the code is good to go, I will put it in the main branch by using git merge or by pushing 
it into the remote test_branch on GitHub then pulling it into the local main on my laptop then pushing it into the remote main on github. If these methods do not work, I will use 
another other method such as the GitHub GUI or by copying and pasting code. 

I am doing the project individually. My responsibilities include code development, security, and hosting the site somewhere. 

The tools I plan using include Visual Studio Code, Git, GitHub and GitHub Actions, and perhaps Docker and and external service to host my site on.
